# 🛡️ GPT Shield: AI Plagiarism Detector

## 📌 Overview
GPT Shield is an advanced AI-generated text detection tool that helps identify potential AI-written content using sophisticated natural language processing techniques. This application analyzes text patterns, perplexity metrics, and linguistic features to determine the likelihood of content being generated by AI models like GPT.

## 🔥 Features
- 🎯 **AI Probability Score**: Overall assessment of how likely the text was generated by AI.
- 📊 **Perplexity Analysis**: Measures how "surprised" a language model is by the input text.
- 🔍 **Burstiness Detection**: Analyzes word repetition patterns characteristic of AI writing.
- 🔄 **N-gram Repetition**: Detects repeated phrases commonly found in AI-generated content.
- 🏗️ **Sentence Complexity Analysis**: Visualizes sentence structure variation.
- 📌 **Word Frequency Visualization**: Displays top repeated words in the analyzed text.
- 📈 **Interactive Visualizations**: Graphs and charts to better understand text patterns.

## ⚙️ How It Works
GPT Shield employs several analytical methods to distinguish between human and AI-generated content:

- 📉 **Perplexity Calculation**: Uses GPT-2 to assess how predictable the text is - AI-generated text typically has lower perplexity than human writing.
- 🔄 **Burstiness Analysis**: Examines statistical patterns of word repetition.
- 📝 **N-gram Repetition**: Identifies repeated phrases that are common in AI outputs.
- 📏 **Sentence Structure Analysis**: Examines sentence length distribution and complexity.

These metrics are combined to produce an overall AI probability score, helping users determine the likelihood that content was generated by an AI system.
